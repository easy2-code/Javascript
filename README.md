Q1: What is Javascript?
Ans: We can define it in many different ways. My definition will be
Javascript is a high level object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language 

Q2: What is programming?
Ans: Programming is a set of instruction that computer must follow to do a specific task.

Q3: Javascript is a high-level language
Ans: Which means that we don't have to think about a lot of complex stuff such as managing the computer memory while it runs or program. In javascript there are a lot of so-called abstractions over all these small details that we don't want to worry about. That's make a lot easier to write and to learn.

Q4: Javascript is object-oriented
Ans: All that means is that the language is mostly based on the concept of objects for storing most kinds of data.

Q5: Javascript is a multi-paradigm language
Ans: Meaning that it's so flexible and versatile, that we can use all kinds of different programming styles, such as imperative and declarative programming. And these different ways of structuring our code basically.

Q6: The role of javascript in web development
Ans: Three core technologies of the web, HTML, CSS and JS, these three technologies all work together to create a beautiful, interactive and dynamic websites

> HTML is responsible for the content of the page, text, images, buttons and all the content that you see on the webpage is always written in HTML.

> CSS is responsible for the presentation of that content so basically for styling and for laying out the element on a webpage.

> JS is the real programming language of the internet and it allows developers to add dynamic and interactive effects to any webpage. We also use it to manipulate the content or the CSS load data from remote servers and really build entire applications in the browser which we then call web applications.
